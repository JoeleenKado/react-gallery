# REACT GALLERY

## The Gallery of your life

_Duration: 15hrs_

I am Full Stack Engineer. But overarching that--along with every other aspect of my life--, I am an artist. We artists rely on self advertisement, if the desire is to land work. The online Gallery enables the Visual Artist/Full Stack Engineer to have a consistent and efficient gallery of the entirety of their collection.
